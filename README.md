By automating these tasks, ClipdorieMac saves time and reduces the need for manual text adjustments or using multiple applications to achieve simple text transformations.

### How to use ? ###

**Using ClipdorieMac**:
   - **Copy Text**: First, copy the text you wish to manipulate to your clipboard.
   - **Activate Hotkey**: Press the predefined hotkey (e.g., "Command + 1") to perform the desired action on the clipboard text. For example, if you've configured a hotkey to clear formatting, pressing it will immediately strip formatting from the copied text.
   - **Result**: The manipulated text is now on your clipboard, ready to be pasted wherever you need it.

**Using the Hotkey**: The magic happens with the predefined hotkey, typically set to Command + 1 (adjustable). This hotkey is your gateway to cycling through a series of text manipulations with each press. Here's what each press does to the text you've copied to your clipboard:

   - **First Press**: Clears formatting and removes extra white spaces, such as spaces before or after sentences. This is perfect for cleaning up text copied from the web or a document.
   - **Second Press**: Removes new line characters and trims any leading or trailing white spaces. Ideal for turning copied multi-line text into a single, neat paragraph.
   - **Third Press**: Converts all your text to lowercase, making it uniform and easy to read.
   - **Fourth Press**: Transforms all your text to uppercase for emphasis or titles.


**Configuring Hotkeys**: By default, the hotkey is set to "Command + 1". This can be customized to suit your preferences. To change the hotkey:
